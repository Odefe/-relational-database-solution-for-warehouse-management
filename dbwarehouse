Project Description:
I successfully implemented a relational database system consisting of four tables: Customer, Ratings, Shipment, and Products. 
These tables demonstrated relationships between each other through the use of appropriate primary and foreign keys, 
ensuring data integrity and efficient data retrieval.

Table 1: Customer
Description: This table represents customer information, each customer details are unique.

Columns:

id (integer): The unique identifier for each customer. Serves as the primary key.
gender (varchar): The customer's gender.
prior_purchases (integer): The number of purchases made by the customer before the current transaction.

Table 2: Ratings
Description: This table holds rating information given by customers on a scale of 1 to 5. It is linked to the Customer table via the customer id.

Columns:

rating_id (integer): The unique identifier for each rating. Serves as the primary key.
customer_care_calls (integer): The number of times customer care was called made related to this rating id.
customer_rating (integer): The rating given by the customer on scale of 1 to 5.
id (integer): The unique identifier of the customer who gave the rating. It's a foreign key referring to the Customer table's id.

Table 3: Products
Description: This table contains information about different products. It's linked to the Shipment table via product id and can also link to the Customer table.

Columns:

product_id (integer): The unique identifier for each product. Serves as the primary key.
cost_of_the_product (decimal): The cost of the product.
product_importance (varchar): The level of importance of the product. Could be either high,medium or low.
weight_in_gms (integer): The weight of the product in grams.
id (integer): The identifier of the customer who bought the product. It's a foreign key that could refer to the Customer table's id.

Table 4: Shipment
Description: This table represents shipping information for various products. It is associated with the Products table via product id.

Columns:

shipment_id (integer): The unique identifier for each shipment. Serves as the primary key.
warehouse_block (varchar): The block section of the warehouse where the product for shipment is stored. The block can either A,B,C,D or F.
mode_of_shipment (varchar): The method used for shipping the product. Can either be ship flight or mode.
discount_offered (integer): The discount offered on the shipment.
reached_on_time_y_n (varchar): Whether or not the shipment reached on time. 1 means its reached on time. 0 means it didn't.
product_id (integer): The unique identifier of the product being shipped. It's a foreign key referring to the Product table's product_id.\


Other Queries used for analysis & Data manipulation:

Created table in pgAdmin to match our data:

CREATE TABLE customer_data (
	ID INT not null ,
    warehouse_block CHAR(1),
    mode_of_shipment VARCHAR(6),
    customer_care_calls INT,
    customer_rating INT,
    cost_of_product DECIMAL(6,2),
    prior_purchases INT,
    product_importance VARCHAR(10),
    gender CHAR(1),
    discount_offered INT,
    weight_in_gms INT,
    reached_on_time INT
);

Queries:

Total number of calls for late deliveries:

SELECT SUM (customer_care_calls) 
FROM customer_data
WHERE reached_on_time = 0;


How many times each mode of shipment was used:

SELECT mode_of_shipment, 
COUNT(*) 
FROM customer_data 
GROUP BY mode_of_shipment;

Percentage of shipments that where on time:

SELECT 
  ((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_data WHERE reached_on_time = 1) * 100.0 /
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer_data)) AS percent_not_ontime;


The average discount offered for Ship delivery for each level of importance:

SELECT product_importance, AVG(discount_offered)
FROM (SELECT * FROM customer_data WHERE mode_of_shipment = 'Ship') 
AS ShipTransactions
GROUP BY product_importance;


Average customer rating for when early and late delivery:

SELECT 
  (SELECT AVG(customer_rating) FROM customer_data WHERE Reached_on_time = 1) AS Avg_Rating_On_Time,
  (SELECT AVG(customer_rating) FROM customer_data WHERE Reached_on_time = 0) AS Avg_Rating_Late;

Average cost of products purchased by males:

SELECT AVG(p.Cost_of_the_Product) 
FROM Products p
WHERE p.ID IN (
    SELECT c.ID 
    FROM Customers c
    WHERE c.Gender = 'M'
);

Most common mode of shipment that was on time:

SELECT s.Mode_of_Shipment, COUNT(*) AS Count
FROM Shipment s
INNER JOIN Products p ON s.Product_ID = p.Product_ID
WHERE s.Reached_on_Time_Y_N = 1
GROUP BY s.Mode_of_Shipment
ORDER BY Count DESC
LIMIT 1;

Number of Customer Calls compared to Average Rating Given:

SELECT c.Customer_care_calls, AVG(r.Customer_rating) AS Average_Rating
FROM ratings c
INNER JOIN Ratings r ON c.ID = r.ID
GROUP BY c.Customer_care_calls
ORDER BY c.Customer_care_calls;


Products that cost above average ordered by weight:

SELECT p.Product_ID, p.Cost_of_the_Product, p.Weight_in_gms
FROM Products p
WHERE p.Cost_of_the_Product > (
    SELECT AVG(Cost_of_the_Product)
    FROM Products
)
ORDER BY p.Weight_in_gms;
